# cchecker

Checks C code and runs the usual analyzers in one command. It runs `gcc -fanalyzer` and `clang-tidy` on each file, in
parallel, and prints what they find in one format with stable codes. A baseline file accepts the findings a project has
today, so CI fails only on new ones. It is written in [Agentica](https://github.com/agentica-lang/agentica).

The rules of a project (a call that must never block, a lock held across a system call, a value restored on every path)
come in later phases and read clang's JSON AST; the plan is in [issue
1](https://github.com/agentica-lang/cchecker/issues/1). This version ships the one command and the annotation header.

## Install

cchecker needs Agentica 0.26.1 or later, and `gcc` 10 or later and `clang-tidy` on PATH. Clone the repository and run
it with `agentica`, or compile it to bytecode:

```sh
agentica cchecker.agc [options] FILE... -- COMPILER-FLAGS...
agentica compile cchecker.agc -o cchecker.agcb      # then: agentica run -- cchecker.agcb [options]
```

## Use

With a compile database (`compile_commands.json`, from CMake, `bear` or `clang -MJ`), run it from the root of the
project:

```sh
agentica cchecker.agc -p build                     # a file or the folder that holds compile_commands.json
agentica cchecker.agc -p build --baseline cchecker-baseline.json
```

Or name the files and give the flags after `--`:

```sh
agentica cchecker.agc src/a.c src/b.c -- -Iinclude -DNDEBUG
```

A finding is one line, `file:line:column CODE message`, and the last line is a summary:

```text
src/a.c:9:12 CC-GCC-ANALYZER-MALLOC-LEAK leak of 'buf'
src/a.c:9:12 CC-TIDY-CLANG-ANALYZER-UNIX-MALLOC Potential leak of memory pointed to by 'buf'
cchecker: 2 new findings in 1 file
```

`--json` prints one object for tools and agents: `clean`, `findings` (each has `code`, `tool`, `file`, `line`, `column`
and `message`), `baselined`, `fixed` and `errors` (a tool that did not run or could not compile a file: `tool`, `file`
and `message`).

Exit codes: `0` no new findings, `1` new findings, `2` a usage error or a tool error. A tool error is a tool that
is missing, ends in a timeout or exits with a non-zero code, except for the `1` of a compiler that found errors in the
file (a file that does not compile is an error, never a finding: gcc 14 refuses an implicit function declaration, for
example). gcc reports its analyzer only (`CC-GCC-ANALYZER-...`); the other warnings of the build flags (`-Wall`) are
not findings, as they are not for clang-tidy.

`-Werror` in the flags of a database does not turn the other warnings of gcc into tool errors: cchecker adds
`-Wno-error` after the flags, and `-Werror=analyzer-...` stays an error, which is a finding. A gcc that exits with `1`
after analyzer errors counts as a finding only when it ends with `cc1: all warnings being treated as errors` or `cc1:
some warnings being treated as errors`; a `cc1` killed halfway prints only `Killed`, and that is a tool error.

Only the C files of a database are run. The paths are relative to the working directory: a file outside it is skipped
(a line on standard error and `skipped` in `--json`), and a finding in a header outside it (a system or third-party
header) is dropped.

### Codes

A code is stable: a baseline holds it. `CC-GCC-` is followed by the gcc warning option in capitals
(`-Wanalyzer-malloc-leak` is `CC-GCC-ANALYZER-MALLOC-LEAK`, also when `-Werror` made it
`-Werror=analyzer-malloc-leak`), and `CC-TIDY-` by the clang-tidy check (`clang-analyzer-unix.Malloc` is
`CC-TIDY-CLANG-ANALYZER-UNIX-MALLOC`). A diagnostic without a name is `CC-GCC-WARNING` or `CC-TIDY-WARNING`.

### Baseline

```sh
agentica cchecker.agc -p build --baseline cchecker-baseline.json --update-baseline   # writes the file, exit 0
agentica cchecker.agc -p build --baseline cchecker-baseline.json                     # fails on new findings only
```

A finding matches the baseline by its code, its file and its message, never its line, so edits above it do not break
the baseline. The file holds a count for each kind, so a second finding of a kind the baseline holds once is new. The
file is read before any tool runs, and written in one rename.

A run covers the tools and the files whose job ended well. Only a full run, which is every file of a database with no
`--exclude`, no FILE subset, no skipped file and no failed job, covers the headers and the files that left the
database. `fixed` counts the accepted findings of that scope that no tool found this time, and `--update-baseline`
replaces the entries of that scope and keeps the others, so `--tools gcc` or a subset of FILEs updates only what it
ran. A header that the run did not name keeps the larger count of its entry, as other flags can show other findings in
it (`#ifdef`); only a full run lowers it. It refuses to write, and leaves the file as it was, when a tool failed, when
the database has a file that was skipped (outside the working directory), or with `--checks` (a baseline made with
other checks would lose the findings of the default ones). The exit code is `2` in each case.

### Options

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `-p, --compile-commands PATH` | the compile database: a file or its folder (default: `compile_commands.json` here) |
| `-t, --tools LIST` | `gcc`, `clang-tidy` or both (default both) |
| `--checks LIST` | the clang-tidy checks, after those of a `.clang-tidy` file; default below |
| `-j, --jobs N` | tool runs at once (default 4) |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | for one tool on one file (default 300); a timeout is a tool error |
| `-b, --baseline FILE`, `--update-baseline` | see above |
| `--exclude LIST` | files or folders to skip, comma separated (`src/vendor`, `./gen/a.c`): whole path parts |
| `--gcc PROGRAM`, `--clang-tidy PROGRAM` | the programs to run, for a versioned name such as `gcc-14` |
| `--json` | one JSON object |

The default checks are `-*`, `clang-analyzer-core.*`, `clang-analyzer-unix.*` and `clang-analyzer-security.*` (without
`insecureAPI`), and the bugprone checks `sizeof-expression`, `integer-division`, `suspicious-memory-comparison`,
`signed-char-misuse`, `misplaced-widening-cast` and `unused-return-value`. The tools run with `LC_ALL=C`, so the
messages are in English on any machine.

A timeout stops the tool and everything it started (gcc runs `cc1` as a child) when `timeout` of coreutils is
installed, and kills what ignores the signal two seconds later. Without it (macOS has none) only the tool itself is
stopped. The limit: Agentica cannot yet start a child in its own process group, so Ctrl-C on cchecker does not stop the
tools that are running (they end by themselves or at the timeout); see
[agentica#1204](https://github.com/agentica-lang/agentica/issues/1204).

## Annotations

`include/cchecker.h` defines the macros that later phases read: `CC_SHORT`, `CC_BLOCKING`, `CC_HOT`, `CC_OWNS`,
`CC_PAIR(set, restore)` and `CC_NO_SYSCALL_UNDER(lock)`. With clang each is
`__attribute__((annotate("cchecker:...")))`; with any other compiler it is empty.

```c
#include "cchecker.h"

CC_SHORT int next_id(void);
void adopt(CC_OWNS char *name);
CC_PAIR(mask_signals, restore_signals) int guarded(void);
```

## Development

The tests are Agentica too: BDD features in `specs/` that run cchecker on the C files of `specs/fixtures/`, and unit
tests in `test/`. They need `gcc`, `clang` and `clang-tidy`.

```sh
make check       # agentica check
make fmt-check   # agentica fmt --check; `agentica fmt` fixes it
make test        # agentica test --jobs 4, from the root of the repository
```
